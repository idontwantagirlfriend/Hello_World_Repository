<div class=subtitle><p><strong>From the coding days at bfsu.</strong></p></div>
<div class=bodytext>
<p>It&#34;s been a few months since I first took my time coding and programming as a hobby.<p/>
<p>The code is somewhat incomplete or tedious, most in C#, javascript, asp.net, html with css, and upcoming php and python. Someday I will be more experienced and tease myself for creating such idiot codes, conversation, or README.md.
